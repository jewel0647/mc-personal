        I started using Tailwind CSS since it&apos;s launch in 2018 and it
        quickly became a staple in all my projects. I regularly use it when
        creating custom components because I prefer to use native elements with
        styling over javascript based components when possible. Using Purge and
        JIT compiling to ensure the smallest file size and fatest page load

                I have worked in web development for over 10 years as a Full
                Stack Developer. I&apos;ve always had a love for technology so
                taking the initiative to learn Full Stack Web Development has
                definitely been one of the most challenging yet amazing
                decisions I&apos;ve ever made. Contributing to web development
                projects and overcoming both personal and professional
                challenges have only further motivated me to continue pursuing
                my career goals within the software development industry This
                journey has also taught me to believe and be kind to myself,
                anything is possible with time and dedication. I can&apos;t wait
                to see where this road take me and I wouldn&apos;t have it any
                other way! When I&apos;m not on the job, I love hiking with my
                dog, working my way through every recipe in the family cookbook,
                and indulging my love for seeing new places.
