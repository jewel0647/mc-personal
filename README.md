-   TypeScript
-   MUI

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## What I want to do more if I have more time

### Table (In production)

-   Add pagination
-   Add actions (Edit, Remove client)

### Search (In production)

-   It's not good to search in Frontend (Need to add new API on Backend)
-   If there are thousands of records and need to implement faster Search, will use 3rd-party service (like Algoria)

### Create a new client

-   Add notification

### Quality and Best practices (In Production)

-   If the codebase grow, will use Redux or other state management library
-   Will use i18n for supporting multiple countries
-   Add Unit testing using Jest and RTL (To ensure the app behaves as I intend it to?)

### Scalability

-   Made the button and other MUI components to cutomize easily
-   Made other basic components to cutomize easily

## How was the test overall?

-   It's enough to measure the engineer's level
